# Sorting algorithms & Big O
* This project is about sorting algorithms and Big O in C.
* Big O notation, sometimes also called `asymptotic analysis`, primarily looks at how many operations a sorting algorithm takes to completely sort a very large collection 
  of data.
* This is a measure of efficiency and is how you can directly compare one algorithm to another.
* Big O notation ranks an algorithmsâ€™ efficiency. It does this with regard to `O` and `n`, ( example: `O(log(n))` ), where:
  * `O` refers to the order of the function, or its growth rate, and
  * `n` is the length of the array to be sorted.
